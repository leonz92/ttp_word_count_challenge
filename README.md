2. Word Count Challenge
# TTP Word Count Challenge

This project is a text analyzer. It can take a body of text and return a number of statistics such as character count, word count, sentence count, etc. It can also scan the text and assess the readability of the text. There are 4 different measures of readability included in the scan. Another feature is the dictionary and thesaurus tool. You can enter a word into the search and it will return the definition and some synonyms as well. The Read Aloud button will read out loud any textr that is highlighted or if no text is highlighted, it reads the text in the input by default.
